# PacMen Exercise
## Description:
This project is a simple exercise to manipulate the DOM. 
It works as a factory for making pacmen and moving around the screen.
Each PacMan moves with a random velocity and position, and if it has a collision with a limit, it direction will be changed.
The limits had been set to the width and height of the screen.

## How to run?
The document displays two buttons, Add PacMan and Start Game.
Add PacMan: The function of this button is to add a new PacMan to the screen.
Start Game: The function of this button is to update the movement of each PacMan by updating its velocity.
            Every time you press it, the velocity of every PacMan will increase.

## Further Improvements:
### Short Term
Add background animations to show a pacMan "real identity".
Add buttons to stop pacMen in their positions.
Add animation to each pacMan to open and close its mouth.
Add an input entry to set up pacMen size.
### Long Term
Make a complete pacMan game for 1 or more players.
